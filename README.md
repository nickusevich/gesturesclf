# Gesture classification
This project was dedicated to the gesture classfication using various ML algorithms during the 1st academic year
The dataset initially was raw and not ready for the classification. Therefore, feature extraction was performed by changing the dataset to an appropriate format and extracting relevant features and for the further analysis.
